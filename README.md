# This is my intership project
# I will show each and every step
# 1. Setup
#   Very first step is create a folder anywhere on your system
#   Now open this folder in VScode
#   Create a Readme.md file in it
#   Open new terminal gitbash or command promt
#   now initialize the git by giving the command git init
#   Create a git repository on github
#   Now you can push the changes done in vscode to git repository directly by using source control or we can use git add .
