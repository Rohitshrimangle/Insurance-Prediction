# This is my intership project
# I will show each and every step
# 1. Setup
#   Very first step is create a folder anywhere on your system
#   Now open this folder in VScode
#   Create a Readme.md file in it
#   Open new terminal gitbash or command promt
#   now initialize the git by giving the command git init
#   Create a git repository on github
#   Now you can push the changes done in vscode to git repository directly by using source control or we can use git add .
#   we can commit by using git commit -m "my first commit"
#   Now by clicking on sync changes option we get a option to choose the repository we have to choose the public repository and a public repository get created on github for the same foder name 
#   We can create the file on github itself by clicking + option on github
# create a gitignore file choose python template and commit on github itself
# create a licence file on github
# now fetch all this changes done on github on your local system by using git pull command on your terminal
# Now we have to create evironment and other installations but if you don't wan t to do it manually then we have to create a script for that we will create a file init_setup.sh here sh (shell) we use this script because if i dont want to write a mannual command and want to automate that process so we will write all commands in shell script this is a linux system script we can't use this in windows unless and untill we use git bash
#  Now use bash init_setup.sh command in bash terminal
# some times the source activate command in shell script don't work in this case we need to activate the environment by giving manual command source activate ./env
#
